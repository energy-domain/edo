## **ðŸŒŸ Executive Summary**  
**Problem**:  
- *"40% of energy asset delays stem from inconsistent data across design/operation teams (McKinsey, 2023)."*  

**EDOâ€™s Solution**:  
- **Technical**: OWL-based framework with lifecycle-aware properties (`asDesigned` â†’ `asOperated`).  
- **Strategic**: Reduces BIM rework by 30% (pilot data) and accelerates ISO 15926 adoption.  

**Visual**:
