**Industrial Energy Asset Ontology (IEAO): A Lifecycle-Aware Semantic Framework for Cross-Domain Interoperability**  
*(Subtitle: "From Design to Decommissioning — Standardized Knowledge Representation for Oil & Gas, Nuclear, and Renewables")*  

---

### **Document Structure**  

#### **1. Executive Summary**  
- **Problem**: Fragmented asset data across lifecycle phases and domains leads to inefficiency.  
- **Solution**: IEAO’s standardized, extensible semantic layer.  
- **Impact**: Enables X% faster data handovers between design and operation phases.  
- **Visual**: Ecosystem diagram showing BIM/IFC, ISO 15926, and CFIHOS integration.  

#### **2. Introduction**  
- **Mission**: To enable seamless information interoperability across the lifecycle of industrial energy assets.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Restriction-based and modular OWL design.  
  - Lifecycle-aware relationships (e.g., design specs → operational parameters).  
- **Scope**: Covers subsea installations, refineries, nuclear plants, and renewables.  

#### **3. Technical Foundations**  
- **3.1. OWL Design Principles**  
  - Restriction-based patterns for consistency.  
  - Modular core with domain extensions (oil & gas, nuclear, renewables).  
- **3.2. Lifecycle Modeling**  
  - Phase transitions (as-designed → as-built → as-operated).  
  - Diagram: Data evolution across lifecycle stages.  
- **3.3. Standards Alignment**  
  - IFC/BIM interoperability and roadmap for ISO 15926/CFIHOS.  

#### **4. Governance & Community**  
- **4.1. Validation Protocol**  
  - Expert review via GitHub PRs and Building Smart collaboration.  
- **4.2. Versioning Strategy**  
  - Semantic versioning with backward compatibility.  

#### **5. Implementation Guidelines**  
- **5.1. Core Ontology Workflows**  
  - Protégé editing, SPARQL queries, SHACL validation.  
- **5.2. Subdomain Specialization**  
  - SPARQL templates for oil & gas, nuclear, and renewables extensions.  
- **5.3. QA & Deployment**  
  - SHACL validation pipeline and BIM tool integration.  

#### **6. Case Studies & Roadmap**  
- **6.1. Pilot Projects**: Example: "Reduced handover delays by X% using IEAO."  
- **6.2. Future Goals**: ISO 15926 alignment and community expansion.  

#### **Appendices**  
- **A. Glossary**: Key industrial terms and ontology classes.  
- **B. Diagram Catalog**: Lifecycle and relationship visuals.  
- **C. SPARQL/OWL Snippets**: Ready-to-use queries for common tasks.
