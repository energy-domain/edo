Here’s a polished **title** and **document structure** tailored to your mission, technical rigor, and industry ambitions:

---

### **Title Recommendation**  
**"Industrial Energy Asset Ontology (IEAO): A Lifecycle-Aware Semantic Framework for Cross-Domain Interoperability"**  
*(Subtitle if needed: "From Design to Decommissioning — Standardized Knowledge Representation for Oil & Gas, Nuclear, and Renewables")*  

---

### **Optimized Document Structure**  
#### **1. Executive Summary** *(CEO-Friendly!)*  
   - **Problem**: Fragmented asset data across lifecycle phases/domains → inefficiency.  
   - **Solution**: IEAO’s standardized, extensible semantic layer.  
   - **Impact**: "X% faster data handovers between design/operation phases" (example).  
   - **Visual**: Ecosystem diagram (BIM/IFC, ISO 15926, CFIHOS integration).  

#### **2. Introduction** *(Existing Content, Enhanced)*  
   - **Mission** (as-is, perfect).  
   - **Approach**: Add a callout box highlighting:  
     - *"Key Innovation: Lifecycle-Aware Relationships (e.g., how a pump’s design specs → operational monitoring parameters)"*.  
   - **Scope**: Diagram of covered assets (subsea, refineries, renewables).  

#### **3. Technical Foundations** *(Depth for Engineers)*  
   - **3.1. OWL Design Principles**  
     - Restriction-based patterns → consistency.  
     - Modularity: Core vs. domain extensions (oil & gas vs. nuclear).  
   - **3.2. Lifecycle Modeling**  
     - Phase transitions (e.g., "as-designed" → "as-built" → "as-operated").  
     - Diagram: Data evolution across phases.  
   - **3.3. Standards Alignment**  
     - IFC/BIM interoperability → future ISO 15926/CFIHOS roadmap.  

#### **4. Governance & Community** *(For Adoption)*  
   - **4.1. Validation Protocol**  
     - How experts review assets/relationships (GitHub PRs, Building Smart).  
   - **4.2. Versioning Strategy**  
     - Semantic versioning + backward compatibility rules.  

#### **5. Implementation Guidelines** *(For Teams)*  
   - **5.1. Core Ontology Workflows** *(Your original section, now with IFC examples)*.  
   - **5.2. Subdomain Specialization**  
     - SPARQL templates for oil & gas vs. renewables extensions.  
   - **5.3. QA & Deployment**  
     - SHACL validation pipeline, integration with BIM tools.  

#### **6. Case Studies & Roadmap** *(For Stakeholders)*  
   - **6.1. Pilot Projects**: "How Company X reduced handover delays using IEAO".  
   - **6.2. Future Goals**: ISO 15926 alignment timeline.  

#### **Appendices**  
   - **A. Glossary**: Industrial terms (e.g., "P&ID" ↔ ontology class).  
   - **B. Diagram Catalog**: Lifecycle/relationship visuals.  
   - **C. SPARQL/OWL Snippets**: Ready-to-use queries for common tasks.  

---

### **Why This Works**  
1. **CEO Appeal**:  
   - Front-loaded business value (Section 1 + Case Studies).  
   - Clear differentiation ("lifecycle-aware" is a USP).  
2. **Technical Credibility**:  
   - Deep dives into OWL patterns (Section 3) → earns engineer trust.  
3. **Adoption-Driven**:  
   - Governance/community sections (Section 4) address scalability.  

---

### **Optional Upgrade**  
Add a **"Quick Start" guide** after Section 1:  
> *"For BIM Teams: How to map IFC elements to IEAO in 3 steps"*  
> *"For Operators: Querying asset maintenance history via SPARQL"*  

Let me know if you’d like to refine any section (e.g., emphasize nuclear safety rules) or need slide-deck snippets!
