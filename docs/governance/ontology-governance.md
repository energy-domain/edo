# Ontology Governance in the Energy Domain Ontology

## Purpose of this section

This section explains how **governance is conceptualised and formalised within the Energy Domain Ontology (EDO)**.

Governance in EDO is not treated as an external process or a set of informal conventions.
It is an explicit part of the ontology ecosystem.

This document describes the intent and role of governance, not its procedural implementation.

---

## Why governance is essential

The EDO is designed to be used as semantic infrastructure.

As such, it must support:
- long-term stability
- controlled evolution
- institutional trust
- contractual reference

Without explicit governance, an ontology becomes a mutable artefact whose meaning changes implicitly over time.

EDO addresses this by embedding governance into its architecture.

---

## Governance as ontology

In EDO, governance is not documented only in text or enforced only by human agreement.

It is **modelled explicitly through governance ontologies** that define:
- how changes are reviewed
- how evolution is controlled
- how semantic consistency is preserved
- how artefacts move from experimental to released status

This approach makes governance:
- inspectable
- versioned
- machine-readable
- auditable

---

## Separation between domain semantics and governance

EDO deliberately separates:
- **domain ontologies**, which describe energy assets and engineering meaning
- **governance ontologies**, which describe how those meanings are reviewed, evolved, and validated

This separation ensures that:
- domain semantics remain focused and stable
- governance can evolve without contaminating domain models
- institutional rules are explicit rather than implicit

---

## Governance and trust

Governance is the mechanism through which EDO establishes and maintains trust.

Trust in EDO does not come from:
- documentation alone
- informal guidelines
- individual authority

It comes from:
- formal semantics
- explicit versioning
- transparent review
- immutable releases

Governance provides the bridge between semantic rigour and institutional adoption.

---

## Lifecycle of ontological artefacts

Within the EDO ecosystem, ontological artefacts move through clearly defined conceptual stages, such as:
- experimental
- transitional
- released

The meaning of these stages is defined formally and consistently across the ecosystem.

Once an artefact is released, it becomes immutable and may be safely referenced in long-term contexts.

---

## Governance as an enabling mechanism

Governance in EDO is not intended to slow down innovation.

On the contrary, it enables:
- parallel evolution of domains
- safe experimentation
- clear promotion paths from experimental to stable semantics

By making governance explicit and formal, EDO allows innovation without sacrificing trust.

---

## Reading governance in the EDO

To understand governance decisions in the EDO:
- consult the relevant governance ontologies
- inspect version histories and releases
- examine formal constraints and annotations

This documentation provides the conceptual framework for interpretation.
The authoritative definitions reside in the ontology itself.
