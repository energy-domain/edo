# Transitional Domain Ontologies

## Purpose of this section

This section explains the role of **transitional domain ontologies** within the Energy Domain Ontology (EDO) ecosystem.

It clarifies what “transitional” means in semantic and architectural terms, and how these ontologies relate to the core, governance, and released artefacts.

This document does not describe domain content or modelling details.
It explains how transitional ontologies should be **understood and interpreted**.

---

## Why transitional ontologies exist

The energy domain evolves continuously.

Engineering knowledge matures through:
- projects
- technical discussions
- contractual agreements
- operational experience

Capturing this knowledge directly in a stable core ontology would either:
- freeze the core too early, or
- force frequent breaking changes

Transitional domain ontologies provide a controlled space where domain semantics can evolve without compromising long-term stability.

---

## Meaning of “transitional”

In the context of EDO, *transitional* does not mean:
- experimental prototypes without structure
- temporary drafts without governance
- informal or provisional artefacts

Instead, a transitional ontology represents:
- a **recognised domain scope**
- a **current consensus snapshot**
- a **semantically coherent specialisation** of the core

It is transitional because its semantics are expected to evolve as domain understanding matures.

---

## Relationship with the core ontology

Transitional domain ontologies:
- extend the core ontology
- never modify or override it
- reuse its abstractions and semantic primitives

This ensures that:
- foundational meaning remains stable
- domain evolution is additive, not disruptive
- different domains remain interoperable through the shared core

The core defines *how meaning is structured*.
Transitional ontologies define *what meaning applies to a given domain*.

---

## Governance of transitional ontologies

Transitional ontologies are governed artefacts.

They:
- follow explicit governance rules
- are subject to review and revision
- may be promoted, refactored, or superseded over time

Governance ensures that transitional does not mean uncontrolled.
It means **managed evolution**.

---

## Transitional versus released artefacts

Not all transitional ontologies are released.

At certain points, a transitional ontology (or a subset of it) may reach sufficient maturity to be:
- frozen
- versioned
- published as a released artefact

Released artefacts are immutable and suitable for long-term contractual reference.

Transitional ontologies, by contrast, remain open to controlled change.

---

## Domain scope and boundaries

Each transitional ontology defines a **clear domain scope**.

Its purpose is to:
- make explicit what is included
- make explicit what is out of scope
- avoid semantic ambiguity across domains

This clarity allows multiple transitional ontologies to coexist, even when they evolve at different speeds.

---

## Transitional ontologies as an architectural mechanism

Transitional domain ontologies are not a workaround.
They are a deliberate architectural mechanism.

They allow EDO to:
- accommodate real-world domain evolution
- support parallel development across disciplines
- preserve semantic integrity and trust

Without transitional ontologies, the EDO would be forced to choose between rigidity and fragmentation.

---

## How to read a transitional ontology

When working with a transitional ontology, it is important to understand that:

- it reflects domain consensus at a given moment in time
- its semantics may evolve
- its relationship to releases is explicit and governed

Transitional ontologies should be read as **living semantic artefacts**, anchored to a stable core and governed by formal processes.

---

## Architectural consequence

The existence of transitional domain ontologies enables the EDO to function as a sustainable semantic ecosystem.

They form the bridge between:
- stable foundational semantics
- evolving domain knowledge
- released contractual artefacts

Understanding this role is essential to understanding how EDO grows without losing coherence.
